0.2.6
 - (spotupnp) fix Spotify podcast won't play

0.2.5
 - (spotupnp) icy.remain must be zerp-initialized 
 
0.2.4
 - (spotupnp) HTTP initial receiver buffer can be bigger than 256...
 - (spotupnp) when receiving HTTP garbage if already connected, don't close
 - (spotupnp) we should not pop a drained streamer when cspot starts sending a new track. Otherwise, if n is playing, and cspot has sent n+1 (all in buffers), then it will start to try to send n+2. It's fine as we only accept 2 streamers but as soon as n is drained, we would pop it out, making some room allowing a UPnP SetNextURI, but n+1 likely has not started playing yet (which is fine) but we don't know if it even has started streaming. It shall be assumed that UPnP only accepts SetNextURI for n+2 after it has requested n+1, not just because it has fully received n. So if we wanted to better handle short tracks, we would need a callback from streamer when a track starts streaming so that we can immediately send another SetNextURI, instead of waiting for the streaming track to start actually playing
 - (spotupnp) increase code buffer size to 4M otherwise we might not have enough data when NextURI starts and player might unexpectingly stops

 - use cspot update that does not deadlock when disconnecting unresponsive player

 - (spotupnp) some player sent out-of-order UPnP response that might cause misdetection of track change and led to removing all HTTPStreamers and crashing
